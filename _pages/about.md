Hi there!

I am a Lecturer in the Department of Creative Technologies, Faculty of Computing and AI at Air University start form Fall 2024. Previously, I obtained my MS degree in the Department of Creative Technologies at <a href="https://www.au.edu.pk/" target="_blank">Air University</a> and was working at the Computational Linguistics Research Group under the supervision of Associate Prof. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imranihsan/" target="_blank"> Dr. Imran Ihsan </a> since 2021. My research interests lie in the general area of artifiicial intelligence, machine learning and data science, and recently Large Language Models (LLM). Here is my [CV](/files/Tahir_CV.pdf).
